Magical Tic Tac Toe uses the mascots of the Hogwarts houses:
Gryffindor: Lion
Slytherin: Serpent
Hufflepuff: Badger
Ravenclaw: Eagle
Instead of X's and O's. So, players would take turns placing their respective house mascots on the grid, aiming to get four of their house mascots in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the game.
